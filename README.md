# Coin-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect and count objects labeled as "Half" and "Pound" in images using a pre-trained YOLO model. The model draws bounding boxes around the detected objects, labels them, and calculates the total count based on the following rules:

Each "Pound" object counts as 1.

Each "Half" object counts as 0.5.

The results are displayed on the image, showing the number of "Pounds," "Halves," and the total count.
